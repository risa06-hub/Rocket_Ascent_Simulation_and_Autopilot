# Rocket_Ascent_Simulation_and_Autopilot
A personal rockect ascent simulation which focuses on the numerical modeling and control simulation of a launch vehicle during its ascent phase. This project uses snesor fusion with Kalman filter and sesnor data using GPS,IMU,Gyroscope models to get the state state estimation of the rocket during its ascent. Project also has autopilot system using guidance and control system which is further used in Thrust Vector Control(TCV).
It also provided the final data analysis and Visualization .
